# About The Project

This project consisted of coding popular games Snake and Pong for a coding competition, The Hackathon.
The games required the creation of coordinate systems using list of lists, and the implementation of
object entity tracking information to determine how the objects of the game should generate and move.

# Required Libraries

To play these games you will be required to have the Python Pygame module installed on your computer.

# Snake
Snake is a game where you play as a snake, and your objective is to get as long as possible
By consuming apples on a grid. You lose if the head of your snake crashes into a wall or 
a part of your body. Each apple consumed increases your length by one block, and your score by 1.

To play Snake you must first initialize the program. The Snake is controlled with the arrow keys.

# Pong

Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle which they must use to avoid a ball
crossing into their side of the field. The ball will bounce off each person's paddle and head to the
other player's field. The first person to miss the ball and let it cross into their area will loose

To play pong, first, initialize the program. The left player paddle is controlled with the W and D keys
for up and down respectively, the right player's paddle is controlled with the arrow keys, up and down
respectively.
